## The Process of Scholarly Communication

--

The scholarly communication is the process of &lt;span style="color:#ffea00"&gt; sharing, disseminating &lt;/span&gt; and
&lt;span style="color:#ffea00"&gt; publishing&lt;/span&gt; research findings of academics and researchers so that the generated
academic contents are made available to the global academic communities (Das, 2015)

## Publishing in Conferences

-  The publications out of the academic conferences, seminars, symposiums, workshops, congresses and similar academic events are commonly known as **conference proceedings.**

--

- Authors often submit papers based on **ongoing research** during these events.

--

- Submitted papers usually undergo a peer review process organized by conference organizers.

--


- After review and revisions, presented papers are published as conference proceedings.

--

- Conference proceedings can be published before (pre-conference) or after (post-conference) the event.

--

- **Pre-conference proceedings** allow authors to improve papers based on reviewers' feedback.

--

- **Post-conference proceedings** offer the chance to enhance papers using feedback from participants, discussants, observers, and session chairs.



&lt;!--

Academic conferences serve as major platforms for scientific discussions.--&gt;


---

## Conference Proceedings and Publishing

- **Collaboration with publishing companies**: Conference organizers often collaborate with publishing companies to produce printed or online conference proceedings.

--

- **Edited book format**: Conference proceedings may take the form of an edited book, which is distributed by publishers.

--

- **ISBN/ISSN identification**: An ISBN or ISSN number is assigned to the edited book for unique identification of the title.

--

- **Online platform**: For online conference proceedings, organizers create a dedicated website.

--

- **Abstracts and full text**: Each conference paper on the website may have separate abstracts or full-text contents.

--

- **Access modes**: Web-based conference proceedings can be accessed either through open access, allowing free access to all, or through toll-access, limited to subscribers.

&lt;!-- As you begin to write your paper, one of the first things you need to be aware of is the structure that is expected in your paper as per the instructions for authors given by your target journal

he expected structure can vary from one journal to another even within the same subject area.

. That said, most research papers in scientific fields follow a typical structure. The main components of this structure are given below:--&gt;

---
## Typical Research Article Structure

  - Title
  - Authors
  - Abstract
  - **Introduction**
  - **Methods**
  - **Results**
  - **Discussion** (sometimes followed by a Conclusion section)
  - Acknowledgements
  - References
  - Appendices (occasionally)
  
--

- IMRD or IMRaD: the items from Introduction to Discussion form the body of a research paper.
- The Results and Discussion sections are not always separate; they may be combined and appear as one section in some papers.
---

## Structuring Your Conference Article


- Each section in IMRaD is basically an answer to a question

--

  - **Introduction**: What is the research problem or question?
  
--

  - **Methods**: What did you do to find the answer?
  
--

  - **Results**: What did you find?
  
--

  - **Discussion**: What do your findings mean?

## Title of a paper

- On academic databases or search engines, the title of a research article is frequently the first thing that people see.

--

- Potential readers may not read the paper if the title is vague or uninteresting.

---

## Abstract

- The abstract is typically the first part of a research paper.

--

- It comes right after the title and list of authors.

--

- Researchers often read the abstract to decide if they want to read the whole paper.

--

- Peer reviewers form their initial impression of the paper from its abstract.

--

-  It can be organized in a mini-IMRaD structure without references (but there are certain exceptions to this rule).

--

- The length of an abstract varies depending on the conference. Look for this information in the instructions for authors for your desired conference.

--



- After you have completed the body of the work, carefully revise the abstract. Check that the content matches what is in the body of the paper.

# Peer Review Process

- Purpose: to enhance the quality of your work.

--

- Reviewing peer review feedback for your conference paper can be a valuable opportunity for improving your work.

--

- **Single Blind Review**: In this type of review, the identity of the authors is known to the reviewers, but the authors don't know the identity of the reviewers. This reduces potential biases. 

- **Double Blind Review**: Both the authors and reviewers are anonymous to each other in double-blind review. This enhances objectivity by eliminating potential bias based on authors' reputation.


---

&lt;img src="fig/20_feedback.jpg" width="90%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---
### Enhancing Quality Through Peer Review and Feedback
