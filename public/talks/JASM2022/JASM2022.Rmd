<!--To identify these anomalies, we need a statistical procedure to distinguish an anomaly due to a technical error from other anomalies, and from regular data-->

### Features of nature-based anomaly types

- Double peaks in turbidity: peaks which are abrupt and clear out of the typical range. If two (or potentially more) peaks are observed in a short time window, may lead to suspect real event (contamination, dredging, etc).

<!--Double peaks in turbidity: peaks which are abrupt and clear out of the typical range. Would be classified as sensor-based error A-type if it was single, but the fact that two (or potentially more) peaks are observed in a short time window (say less than one hour), may lead to suspect real event (contamination, dredging, etc)

Dredging is the act of removing silt and other material from the bottom of bodies of water. 

-  Massive input of SPM load, possibly starting by a strong peak. This is the typical signature of a flood event

but there is no direct relationship between the discharge and the incoming SPM load (history effect, hysteresis, etc).

- Very large resuspension event. These turbidity pulses of few hours can be related to the resuspension of recently deposited sediment, or interaction with the tide.

- Non-flushing periods. In low discharge and low tidal range conditions, the salty marine waters are not expelled out of the estuary. The salinity remains high for days, which can have consequences on the local ecosystems and the aquifer.
.-->

<!--The term "salinity" refers to the concentrations of salts in water or soils. Salinity can take three forms, classified by their causes: primary salinity (also called natural salinity); secondary salinity (also called dryland salinity), and tertiary salinity (also called irrigation salinity).-->

<!--the tidal mouth of a large river, where the tide meets the stream.-->

- In this application, we consider Pringle Creek (Figure 8), one of the NEON (National Ecological Observatory Network) aquatic sites located in Wise County, Texas, USA and managed by the U.S Forest Services-->

- Pringle Creek, NEON (National Ecological Observatory Network) aquatic sites located in Wise County, Texas, USA
- NEON usually has two sensor locations on any river in the network where water quality is measured using in-situ sensors.

<!--
-  In Pringle Creek, these locations are situated about 200 m apart where a small tributary entering to the main creek between the two sensors.-->
