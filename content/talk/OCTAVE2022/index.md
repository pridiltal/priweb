abstract: With the increasing availability of high-quality image streams in various applications, anomaly detection of image streams is a field of study that is growing in popularity. This study proposed a novel framework for the early detection  of anomalous behaviours present in image streams. The class imbalance problem, the interdependency between the images with regard to time, the lack of available
labeled images, a data-driven anomalous threshold,  and the trade-off of accuracy while increasing interpretability in the black-box optimization methods are some of the key aspects concerned during the model building process.
