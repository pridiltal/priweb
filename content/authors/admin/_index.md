I am a Lecturer in the [Deparment of Computational Mathematics, University of Moratuwa](https://www.mrt.ac.lk/staff/Talagala.PD.php). I earned my PhD in Statistics from Monash University, Australia, under the supervision of [Professor Rob J. Hyndman](https://robjhyndman.com/) and [Professor Kate Smith-Miles](http://katesmithmiles.wixsite.com/home).  I am a fellow of OWSD, a programme unit of UNESCO (2021-2022). 

I am also an Associate Investigator of the [Australian Research Council (ARC) Centre of Excellence for Mathematical and Statistical Frontiers (ACEMS), Australia](https://acems.org.au/our-people/priyanga-dilini-talagala). Further, I am a co-founder of [R-Ladies Colombo,](https://rladiescolombo.netlify.com/) a local chapter of the [R-Ladies Global Organization](https://www.rladies.org).


My research focuses on statistical machine learning and data mining, and in particular   the development of novel methods and tools for analyzing complex data. I am also strongly committed to develop open source software tools to facilitate reproducible research. You can find some of my projects [here](https://prital.netlify.com/#projects). Visit me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/pridiltal), I post mostly about R, Statistics, Data Science and science in nature. 


[Thiyanga Talagala, PhD in Statistics, Monash University, Australia](https://thiyanga.netlify.com/) is my sister.
