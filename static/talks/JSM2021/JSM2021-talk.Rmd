- Strong winds can damage the panel's system. Consequently, there is an option to add a wind sensor to this system. The sensor provides information about wind speed and is input into Pin8. https://www.fierceelectronics.com/components/solar-tracker-improves-energy-output-solar-panels
- Real-time Alert system and pipeline Leakage detection
Biz4Intellia, an end-to-end IoT solution saves bucks to the companies by providing instant notification of pipeline leakage. By quickly addressing the problem, our solution prevents oil/gas seeping further into the environment where it could have a significant impact on wildlife, plants, and water. The Real-time Alert system detects the leakage and addresses them immediately, which saves money, oil, and the environment. All the information from the sensors is acquired and sent to the cluster cloud. With all the real-time data and geek technology one can predict the 96% accurate data and can send alerts well before time. The moment a leak alert is received, one can take immediate action to ensure that damage is mitigated.

https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/19/11/2548/htm
The operation principle of this method is that cable temperature will change when pipeline leakage occurs and hydrocarbon fluid engross into the coating cable. By measuring the temperature variations in fibre optic cable anomalies along the pipeline can be detected [4]. Distributed Optical Fibre Sensor (DOFS) provides environmental measurements based on three classes of scattering, namely Raman, Rayleigh and Brillouin scattering [64]. These classifications are based on the frequency of the optical signals as illustrated in Figure 3. Brillouin scattering can measure both strain and temperature but is very sensitive to strain, while Raman scattering is only sensitive to temperature, with greater ability to accurately measure 


- Energy Outlier Detection in Smart Environments
- Earlier studies have shown that home residents reduce en- ergy expenditure by 5-15% on average just as a response to acquiring and viewing raw usage data (Darby 2006). Tra- ditional power meters provide only basic consumption data such as current power usage and killowatt hour. There is a clear need for improving householders??? working knowledge of their behaviors and energy consumption. Pervasive com- puting techniques can improve the quality of information supplied to users by identifying usage trends and anoma- lies, and providing users with suggestions about how to save energy and conserve natural resources.

Anomaly detection is valuable because the anomaly may indicate an unnecessary use of resources (e.g., an appliance was accidentally left on), an unsafe state, or possibly noise in the dataset which needs to be removed.

<!-- This paper explains the multi-way decomposition method PARAFAC and its use in chemometrics. PARAFAC is a generalization of PCA to higher order arrays, but some of the characteristics of the method are quite different from the ordinary two-way case. There is no rotation problem in PARAFAC, and e.g., pure spectra can be recovered from multi-way spectral data. One cannot as in PCA estimate components successively as this will give a model with poorer fit, than if the simultaneous solution is estimated. Finally scaling and centering is not as straightforward in the multi-way case as in the two-way case. An important advantage of using multi-way methods instead of unfolding methods is that the estimated models are very simple in a mathematical sense, and therefore more robust and easier to interpret. All these aspects plus more are explained in this tutorial and an implementation in Matlab code is available, that contains most of the features explained in the text. Three examples show how PARAFAC can be used for specific problems. The applications include subjects as: Analysis of variance by PARAFAC, a five-way application of PARAFAC, PARAFAC with half the elements missing, PARAFAC constrained to positive solutions and PARAFAC for regression as in principal component regression.

### Anomalous score calculation using Robust three-way analysis


<!-- 
****Parafac Can be seen as an expansion of PCa from two way data to multiway data


In particular, given the true multi-way nature of the data, PARAFAC model turned out to be extremely useful in the study of the dependence of colour variation on pigments, a critical issue for painted surfaces, that was not clear using univariate approach.

### Advantages of the  mask framework 

- Detect spacial anomalies in  spatio-temporal tensor data 
--

- Can take the correlation structure of the  variables into account when detecting anomalies
--

- Deal with large amounts of data efficiently 
--

- Deal with time series of different lengths and/or starting points
--

- Anomalous scoring techniques- unsupervised
--

- Anomalous threshold has a probabilistic interpretation
--

- The framework can easily be extended to streaming data such that it can provide near-real-time support


<!-- - Thus, this representation can allow an algorithm to compare time series of different lengths and/or starting points, because it can transform time series of any length or starting point into a vector of features of a fixed size.

Thus, this representation can allow an algorithm to compare time series of different lengths and/or starting points, because it can transform time series of any length or starting point into a vector of features of a fixed size. Recently, researchers such as Wang, Smith, and Hyndman (2006), Fulcher (2012) and Hyndman, Wang, and Laptev (2015) have paid a considerable amount of attention to the feature-based representation of time series, since it helps to reduce the dimension of the original multivariate time series problem via features that encapsulate the dynamic properties of the individual time series efficiently.

Does not require a training set to build the decision model

### What next?

- Explore more on feature extraction and feature selection methods to create a better feature space suitable for streaming data context.
--

- Use other dimension reduction techniques for tensor data such as Tucker3 models,  multilinear PLS (N-PLS) to see the effect on the performance of the proposed framework.
--

- Develop effective, interactive data visualisation tools for further investigation of the detected spacial anomalies.
