## The Process of Scholarly Communication

The scholarly communication is the process of sharing, disseminating and
publishing research findings of academics and researchers so that the generated
academic contents are made available to the global academic communities (Das, 2015)

## Publishing in Conferences

-  The publications out of the academic conferences, seminars, symposiums, workshops, congresses and similar academic events are commonly known as conference proceedings

--

- Authors often submit papers based on **ongoing research** during these events.

--

- Submitted papers usually undergo peer review by organizers.

--


- After review and revisions, presented papers are published as conference proceedings.

--

- Conference proceedings can be published before (pre-conference) or after (post-conference) the event.

--

- **Pre-conference proceedings** allow authors to improve papers based on reviewers' feedback.

--

- **Post-conference proceedings** offer the chance to enhance papers using feedback from participants, discussants, observers, and session chairs.



<!--

Academic conferences serve as major platforms for scientific discussions.-->

<!-- As you begin to write your paper, one of the first things you need to be aware of is the structure that is expected in your paper as per the instructions for authors given by your target journal

he expected structure can vary from one journal to another even within the same subject area.

. That said, most research papers in scientific fields follow a typical structure. The main components of this structure are given below:-->

---
## Typical research article structure

  - Title
  - Authors
  - Abstract
  - **Introduction**
  - **Methods**
  - **Results**
  - **Discussion** (sometimes followed by a Conclusion section)
  - Acknowledgements
  - References
  - Appendices (occasionally)
  
--

- IMRD or IMRaD: the items from Introduction to Discussion form the body of a research paper.
- The Results and Discussion sections are not always separate; they may be combined and appear as one section in some papers.
---

## Structuring Your Conference Article


- Each section in IMRAD is basically an answer to a question

--

  - **Introduction**: What is the research problem or question?

  - **Methods**: What did you do to find the answer?

  - **Results**: What did you find?

  - **Discussion**: What do your findings mean?

---

## Title of a paper

- On academic databases or search engines, the title of a research article is frequently the first thing that people see.

--

- Potential readers may not read the paper if the title is vague or uninteresting.

---

## Abstract

- The abstract is typically the first part of a research paper.

--

- It comes right after the title and list of authors.

--

- Researchers often read the abstract to decide if they want to read the whole paper.

--

- Peer reviewers form their initial impression of the paper from its abstract.

--

- The length of an abstract varies depending on the conference. Look for this information in the instructions for authors for your desired conference.

--

-  It can be organized in a mini-IMRAD structure without references (but there are certain exceptions to this rule).

--

- After you have completed the body of the work, carefully revise the abstract. Check that the content matches what is in the body of the paper.

# Peer review process

- Purpose: to enhance the quality of your work.

--

- Reviewing peer review feedback for your conference paper can be a valuable opportunity for improving your work.

--

- **Single Blind Review**: In this type of review, the identity of the authors is known to the reviewers, but the authors don't know the identity of the reviewers. This reduces potential biases. 

- **Double Blind Review**: Both the authors and reviewers are anonymous to each other in double-blind review. This enhances objectivity by eliminating potential bias based on authors' reputation.

```

---
### Enhancing Quality through Peer Review and Feedback


- **Take Time to Absorb**: When you receive the feedback, take some time to absorb it before reacting. This helps you approach the feedback with a clear and open mind.

--

- **Stay Objective**: Approach the feedback with an objective mindset. Remember that reviewers are providing their perspective to help you enhance your paper.

--

- **Read Carefully**: Read each comment and suggestion carefully. Make sure you understand the reviewer's point before responding.

--

- **Separate Emotion**: If you receive critical feedback, try to separate your emotional response from the feedback itself. Focus on the content and constructive aspects of the comments.



---

### Enhancing Quality through Peer Review and Feedback



- **Prioritize Feedback**: Not all feedback is of equal importance. Prioritize suggestions that are fundamental to the quality and clarity of your paper.

--

- **Accept and Reject**: Be prepared to accept feedback that resonates with you and reject suggestions that you believe aren't suitable for your work. Just ensure **your decisions are well-justified**.
--

- **Consult with Co-authors**: If you have co-authors, discuss the feedback with them. Collaborative input can lead to better revisions.

--

- **Be Thankful**: Respond to the reviewers with gratitude for their time and effort. A positive attitude can foster a productive exchange of ideas.

--

- **Stay Resilient and Reflective**: Regardless of the outcome, approach it as a learning opportunity. Reflect on feedback, whether it's for revisions, acceptance, or rejection, to enhance your research skills and improve future work.
