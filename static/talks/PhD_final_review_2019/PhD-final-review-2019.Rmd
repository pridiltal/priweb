### Main Contributions
- Propose a framework that provides early detection of anomalies within a large collection of streaming time series data
--

- Propose an algorithm that adapts to nonstationarity (concept drift)

--

### Main Assumptions

- A representative data set of the system's typical behavior is available to define the model for the typical behavior of the system.
--

- We define an anomaly as an observation that is very unlikely given the recent distribution of a given system

--

### Proposed Algorithm

- Off-line Phase: Building a model of a system's typical behaviour; (similar to Clifton, Hugueny & Tarassenko, 2011)
--

- On-line Phase: Testing newly arrived data using the boundary

### Anomalous threshold calculation 

- Estimate the probability density function of the 2D PC space $\longrightarrow$ Kernel density estimation
--

- Draw a large number N of extremes $(arg min_{x\in X}[f_{2}(x)])$ from the estimated probability density function
--

- Define a $\Psi$-transform space, using the $\Psi$-transformation defined by (Clifton et al., 2011)

```{r   echo=FALSE, out.width = "50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/10_psitrans.png")
```

- $\Psi$-transform maps the density values back into space into which a Gumbel distribution can be fitted.

## Anomaly Detection for High Dimensional and Streaming Temporal Data

---
### Main Contributions
- Propose a framework to detect anomalies in high dimensional data. Our proposed algorithm addresses the limitations of HDoutliers algorithm (Wilkinson, 2018).
--

- Propose an algorithm to detect anomalies in streaming temporal data
--


### What is an anomaly ?
- We define an anomaly as an observation that deviates markedly from the majority with a large distance gap.
--


### Main Assumptions
- There is a large distance between typical data and the anomalies in comparison to the distance among typical data.


---

```{r  echo=FALSE, out.width = "60%", fig_align = 'top'}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/P2_plot5.png")
```
-  Normalize the columns of the data. (median and IQR)
-  This prevents variables with large variances having disproportional influence on Euclidean distances.
---


```{r  echo=FALSE, out.width = "60%", fig_align = 'top'}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/P2_plot6.png")
```
- Leader Algorithm (Hartingan, 1975)
- $r= 1/2(1/n)^{1/d}$: expected distance between data points in a d-dimensional space. n is the sample size (Kantardzic, 2011)

```{r  echo=FALSE, out.width = "60%", fig_align = 'top'}

```

```{r  echo=FALSE, out.width = "60%", fig_align = 'top'}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/P2_plot9.png")
```

- Select the k nearest neighbour distance with the maximum gap

--
- Sort the resulting k nearest neighbour distances

--
- Define an anomalous threshold using Extreme Value Theory  (Bottom up searching algorithm proposed by Schwarz, 2008)

### Identify anomalous series within a large collection of time series

- use a moving window to deal with streaming data


- Extract time series features from window


- Apply stray algorithm to identify anomalous series

.pull-left[

```{r   echo=FALSE, out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/P2_plot22.png")
```

]
.pull-right[
```{r   echo=FALSE, out.width = "70%"}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/stray.gif")
```
]

`tsfeatures <- oddstream::extract_tsfeatures(ts_data)` <br/>
`outliers <- stray::find_HDoutliers(tsfeatures)` <br/>
`stray::display_HDoutliers(tsfeatures, outliers)`


---
### Advantages of the Proposed Algorithm

- Detect clusters of outlying points
--

- Applied to both uni- and multi- dimensional data
--

- Handle large datasets due to the use of a one-pass algorithm
--

- Does not require a training set to build the decision model
--

- Deal with multimodal typical classes
--

- Outlier threshold has a probabilistic interpretation

### Advantages of the proposed framework

- Can take the correlation structure of the water-quality variables into account when
detecting outliers
--

- Applicable to both univariate and multivariate problems
--

- Outlier scoring techniques- unsupervised
--

- Outlier thresholds have a probabilistic interpretation 
--

- The framework can easily be extended to streaming data such that it can provide near-real-time support
--

- Proposed framework has the ability to deal with irregular (unevenly spaced) time series

---

### Main Contributions

- Proposed an unsupervised framework that provides early detection of technical outliers in water-quality data from  *in situ* sensors.
--

- Provided a comparative analysis of the efficacy and reliability of both density- and nearest neighbor distance-based outlier scoring techniques.
--

- Introduced an R package, `oddwater` that implements the proposed framework
and related functions.

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("pridiltal/oddwater")
```
- `oddwater` package also provides a shiny app to explore data. 


```{r eval = FALSE, echo=TRUE}
